## About Christopher Brossman
I am the glue between the business world and the analytical world. As a communicator and project manager, I lead high-value business projects from ideas to reality. As a data scientist, I rely on my experience with data warehousing, machine learning, and computer programming to develop novel solutions. 

I am a life-long learner. You can find me in coffee shops learning new techniques to implement. I teach economics part-time and co-run the Norfolk Data Science group. When not infront of a computer I will be on a kayak or hiking in nature.
